# Platooning Solutions For Self Driving Vehicles
 
Simulation program for finishing thesis at the Computer Science (BSc) at the Budapest University Of Technology And Economics.


## Motivation

The goal was to test whether it was beneficial to adapt the platooning techniques used by cyclists to the movement and control of self driving vehicles.


## Main Functions

- Controlled car flow on a set length of highway 
- Uncontrolled car flow on a set length of highway
- Controlled car flow on an infinite, circular path
- Uncontrolled car flow on an infinite, circular path
- Changing the "slowing speed" to find optimal value


## How To Run The Program
